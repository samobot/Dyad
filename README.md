This is an Android app I designed for my high school science fair.&nbsp; It's a proof of concept that combines the controls for Philips Hue and LIFX smart lights into one app and aims to simplify the setup process.&nbsp; I wanted to add support for Honeywell thermostats as well, but the control API was not public when I wrote the app.&nbsp; UI is available in English, Spanish, and Russian
